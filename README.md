# Project 1
 
**Title:** [Student Performance Factor Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/Bimboly/Bimboly.github.io/blob/main/Student%20Performance%20Factors%20Dashboard.xlsx)
 
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Chart, Pivot tables, Conditional formating, filters, slicers, timelines)
 
**Project Description:** The goal of this project was to identify and analyze various factors influencing student performance. Key factors such as attendance, study hours, parental involvement, and socio-economic status were explored to understand their impact on academic outcomes. The data used for this project was from student records, including performance metrics (Exam Scores), attendance rates, study habits, parental background, and socio-economic factors.

The lifestyle of male and female students was also evaluated in terms of their sleeping habit, parental involvement, and this was analysed using both the pie chart and the stacked column chart. Based on the following explained analysis, the most influential factors on student performance were study hours and attendance.
